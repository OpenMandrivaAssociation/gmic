    1. 	Don't try to use the cmake build. It doesn't work, at least not for me.
    2. 	One thing that is essential to know is that the Makefile downloads files from the gmic site. This will not work when building on abf.
    3. 	The files that are needed to build the package are not present in the tagged tar.gz archives on github or in the releases.
    4.	To get these files you have to be on an internet connected machine but not on abf
    5. 	The two files is question are gmic_stdlib.h and gmic_stdlib_community.h the former is required to build the gmic libraries 
	and utilities and the latter to compile the QT interface.
    6. 	These can be retrieved in their proper form by by running two makefile targets using the Makefile in the gmic-$(version) src directory
    7.	Ensure that you have all the necessary build tools installed on the local machine. 'dnf install task-devel abf-console-client abb' should be sufficient.
    8.  Clone the gmin repository from the OpenMandriva git with "abf get gmic"
    9.	Run abb buildp to prepare the BUILD directory
    10. Enter the BUILD directory and navigate to the gmic-$(version) src directory
    11.	Run the following make commands 'make gmic_stdlib.h' and make gmic_stdlib_community.h
    12. Copy the files to the root of the git repo so that they can be pushed along with spec file update. 
	They will be copied across to the BUILD directory when the packages are built on abf.
	Make sure the new files are committed to git when pushing to github.
